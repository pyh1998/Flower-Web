            A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, 
            in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and 
            tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be 
            erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. 
            Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging 
            from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers 
            native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.
